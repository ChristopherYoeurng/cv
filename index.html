  <br>
  <p>I am a Web Developer from the Los Angeles Area. I <strong>LOVE</strong> Broadway and anything with Alfredo sauce on it. <em><strong>MMM!</strong></em>
    <br>
    <br>
    I started coding when I was in the <em>1st grade</em>, starting with simple
    <strong>Python</strong> commands.
    Later, in the <em>4th grade</em>, my friends and I all tested past the curriculum our elementary school provided. To keep getting money for our attendance though,
    the school would keep us in the same grade but let us make our own curriculum under teacher supervision, finding whatever courses our <em>4th grade</em>
    selves wanted and doing that while the other kids did mind numbing "i-ready" modules, my friend Hannah and I elected to learn <strong>Javascript</strong>. So that
    is how it all started for me. For the <em>next two years in elementary school</em> Hannah and I would, then, bond over our newest games and the subsequent
    struggles with debugging it. I would go on to dabble in <strong>C</strong> in <em>middle school</em>, developing my skills in <strong>HTML</strong> and <strong>CSS</strong> near the <em>end of Middle School</em> and through
    <em>freshman year of High School</em>. I would go on to start my school's Coding Club with a friend, teaching Python to beginners that are curious about the world
    of code.
